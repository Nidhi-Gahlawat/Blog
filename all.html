<p class="quote">“If you don’t like to read, you haven’t found the right book.”</p>
<p style="text-align: right; font-weight: bold;">- J.K. Rowling</p>    
<p class="con">
    So you landed here to read about the books I read till now. Well the list is not too long but still worths an overview.
    I have always been a reader because my father used to brought so many books when I was a kid.
   I got addicted to books when I was around 13 years in class 8th as I got the access to library. I used to borrow books mostly from school library and a couple of times from a classmate 
    who used to borrow them from her neighbour and was an ardent novel addict. Then after 10th I almost left reading books other than academic ones
    due to pressure to score good in boards. After 12th I continued reading and explored the various genres. 
</p>
<p class="con"> Now let's dive into the name of books with their authors. I have arranged them in the order 
    of reading them.
